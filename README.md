# Tutorial Emavi: Concurrent Systems

## Abstract

Nowadays, concurrent systems (i.e., systems of agents or processes that interact with each other) are ubiquitous in several domains and applications. They are commonplace in different areas, ranging from biological systems to mobile and cloud services. In general, concurrent systems exhibit complex forms of interaction, not only among their internal components, but also with the surrounding environment. Some of them are critical systems where failures cannot be admitted, as they may cost lives, economical losses or breaches to our privacy and security. In this talk, I will give a gentle introduction to rewriting logic (RL) and its implementation in the system Maude. Through several examples (e.g., security protocols, mutex algorithms, multimedia interacting systems, controllers, etc.)  I will show how different concurrent behaviors can be specified, simulated and reasoned about in the RL framework. No previous knowledge on these topics are required from the audience.

## Examples
Some of the examples in Maude contained here have been adapted from
